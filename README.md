# DASC41103 Machine Learning Project 1
This will guide through the installation and running of code within file.  
- First, download the repo as a folder
- Next, open the file DASC41103Project1_FinalVersion.ipynb in your favorite IDE (ie. VSCode)
- Ensure that your environment has the correct packages installed (using the same environment as we made at the beginning of this class should suffice)
- Press run all, which should run through the entire program.
- This will also create 4 output files used for validation (although there are versions of those files already present, just in case there is a problem)
